## Hi, I'm Yujin Choi

- I am an undergraduate student at Yonsei University in South Korea, majoring in Bio-convergence.
- I'm particularly interested in developing small-molecule drugs targeting GPCRs, especially those related to neuronal function, though my interests span cell biology and molecular biology broadly.
- Currently studying and assisting with experiments at Dr. Kang's [Cell Signaling and Molecular Pharmacology laboratory](https://www.cellsignalingandmolecularpharmacologylab.com/).
